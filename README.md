Bash Script to take a tab delimited file of grades for example, and displays averages and a *median by either column or row.

*the median in this case needed to be a real value, and not a calculated median. It takes the higher of the middle scores.

may or may not require bash >= version 4

Good project to lern vim on, now evertime I finish a file and want to save I want to hit :w
